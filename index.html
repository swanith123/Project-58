         <p id="p">My favorite hobby is gaming fun and amazing games whenever I am free. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays I can game on my iPad for 2 hours. I play many games like Roblox, Minecraft, Among Us, and even Rocket Leauge. My favorite game is probally Roblox since I have played it for a very long time. I would game with my cousin for India and with my best friends. I think gaming can help with your focus and hand-eye corridanation. There are some dis-advantages of gaming which keeps you very distracted from other things. This is why my favorite hobby is gaming and will be in the future. These games are very popular having Rocket League having a 8/10, Forza Horizon 4 having a 9.6/10, Roblox having a 9.2/10, Minecraft having a 9/10, and Among Us having 10/10.  </p>
